# Node Express Page Visits Counter with Docker Compose

This project demonstrates a simple page visit counter built using Node.js and Express, containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose. Every time you visit the page, the visit count increments and is displayed on the page.

## Features

- **Node.js and Express**: Backend server to handle HTTP requests and serve the visit count.
- **Docker**: Containerize the application for easy deployment.
- **Docker Compose**: Simplifies multi-container Docker applications, in this case, for orchestrating the app and any required services (e.g., database, cache).
- **Persistent visit count**: Uses a simple file or database to persist the count across container restarts.
